# Raw Unedited Notes

Kids can go hungry if they don't eat what everyone else is eating

We strive to not default to consuming screen time activity

It is okay for kids to be bored


Confidence with kids is ok, don't tell them that the secret is safe if it is not; ask them to talk to parents first if you want to tell parents


Different motivation styles are okay, your responsibility is not to make the kids comfortable


We do not need to solve child's issues for them - guide, call out, but not directly solving

We strive to not undermine other parent philosophies that we disagree with and assume they act the same


If there's any substance that is possibly unsure about parents, ask the parents if it's ok; r rated movies, tattoos piercing, 

Value diversity of parenting values approaches etc, it is an asset

Body positivity and self touch not shamed?

Meet them at their age but not trying to lie overtly; not trying to obscure reality

Okay with storytelling

Could we align on a Xmas tradition and story?
Andreas: I am not going to tell you where they came from

Kids encourage to go outside without shoes

Natural consequences

Don't expect of kids that you don't do yourself 


Substance use- not in front of other kids? Altered state of consciousness in front of other kids
